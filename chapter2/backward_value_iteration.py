    Compute V*(x) = optimal cost-to-go from every state x to the goal. 

    Bellman equation (backward):

    The anchor is V(goal) = 0. The dependency chain runs:

    Each sweep applies Bellman update to every state. Value only ever decrease (costs improve)
    The algorithm terminates when no value changed by more than tol in a full sweep --
